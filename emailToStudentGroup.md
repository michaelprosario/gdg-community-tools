Subject: Invitation for your students: DevFest GemJam Hackathon

Hi [Professor/Student Group Leader Name],

My name is Michael, and I'm an organizer for the Google Developers Group of Central Florida. I'm reaching out because I'm passionate about helping students get a head start in their tech careers.

We're hosting our annual DevFest GemJam hackathon from October 25th, and I would be thrilled to have students from [University/College/Club Name] participate. This year's event is all about building innovative GenAI applications using Google's Gemini suite of tools.

This is a fantastic opportunity for students to:
*   **Gain Real-World Experience:** Get hands-on with cutting-edge GenAI technologies like Gemini, Google Cloud, and Firebase, which looks great on a resume.
*   **Network with Professionals:** Connect with experienced developers, designers, and tech leaders from the Orlando area.
*   **Win Awesome Prizes:** Compete for prizes and get recognition for their hard work and creativity.
*   **Learn and Grow:** It's a fun, supportive environment to learn new skills, regardless of their current experience level.

We would be grateful if you could share this opportunity with your students. We even have a special 10% discount code (`FLASHSALE`) just for them.

Here's the link to the event for more details and registration: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/devfest-gemjam-tickets-1032640023107?aff=oddtdtcreator

Let's work together to inspire the next generation of tech talent in Orlando!

Best regards,
