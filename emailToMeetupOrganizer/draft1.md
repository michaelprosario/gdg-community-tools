Collaborating on DevFest GemJam for our developer communities

Hi [Organizer Name],

My name is Michael, and I organize the Google Developers Group of Central Florida. I'm reaching out because I believe we share a common goal: strengthening our local developer community.

We're hosting our annual DevFest GemJam hackathon from Oct 25th, and I'd love to invite your members to participate. This year's focus is on building innovative GenAI applications with Google's Gemini suite.

I see a great opportunity for our communities to support each other. Hereâ€™s how your members could benefit:
*   **Skill Up:** A chance to get hands-on experience with cutting-edge GenAI tools (Gemini, Google Cloud, Firebase).
*   **Networking:** Connect with other passionate developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts in the area.
*   **Prizes & Recognition:** Win prizes and get recognition for their projects.

In return, we'd be happy to:
*   Promote your meetup group to our members.
*   Offer a special discount for your community.
*   Explore other ways we can collaborate in the future.

Would you be open to sharing this with your members? We have a special 10% discount code (`FLASHSALE`) for them.

Let's work together to grow Orlando's tech scene!

Best,
