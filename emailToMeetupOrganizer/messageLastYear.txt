Hi. My name is Michael.   As a fellow community organizer for devs, I wanted to extend a warm invite to you and your community.  Google devs of Central Florida is hosting the DevFest GemJam on Oct 25! 

DevFest GemJam is a week-long hackathon event focused on building GenAI-powered applications to promote creativity and collaboration. The event encourages the responsible and ethical use of AI to augment human problem-solving. Participants will use Google's Gemini AI suite, Google Cloud Platform, and Firebase to develop their projects. The event features tracks for Software Prototyping and App Design. It includes an in-person kickoff on October 25, followed by a week of building, and concludes with a Demo Day and celebration.
