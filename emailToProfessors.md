Subject: Invitation for your students: DevFest GemJam AI Hackathon

Dear Professor [Professor's Last Name],

My name is Michael, and I organize the Google Developers Group of Central Florida. I'm reaching out to you because we are hosting an event that could be a valuable experience for your students.

Our annual DevFest GemJam, a week-long hackathon starting October 25th, is focused on building innovative GenAI applications using Google's Gemini suite, Google Cloud, and Firebase.

This event offers a great opportunity for your students to:
*   **Gain Real-World Experience:** Get hands-on practice with cutting-edge AI tools, which is a fantastic addition to their resume and portfolio.
*   **Network with Professionals:** Connect with local developers, designers, and tech leaders.
*   **Showcase Their Skills:** Build a project, compete for prizes, and gain recognition in the tech community.

We believe this is a great way for students to apply their academic knowledge to a practical project and get a feel for the tech industry.

Would you be willing to share this opportunity with your students? We have a special student discount code (`FLASHSALE`) for 10% off the ticket price.

Here is the link to the event for more details and registration:

Best regards,
